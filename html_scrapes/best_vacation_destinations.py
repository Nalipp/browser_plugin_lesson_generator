But there are also so many underrated places that are severely underlooked. So, I asked the BuzzFeed Community to tell me about a destination they loved even more than expected. Here are some of their responses. I also shared one of my own favorite places and a handful of responses from some travel-loving Redditors.\n1. \"Moab, Utah. We stayed a week. Every day there were spectacular day roadtrips to take. The scenery in Canyonlands and Arches National Parks was beyond anything we'd ever seen. We saw petroglyphs and dinosaur tracks and fossils. There are short and long hikes with amazing scenery, but you can also see it right from the side of the road. Four-wheel drive tours and rafting on the Colorado River are just a few of the outdoor activities you can take part in. And the fall colors in the nearby mountains were enchanting. Make sure to hit Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly while you’re in the area!\"\nMimi Ditchie Photography / Getty Images\n\n—deliciousphone70\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n2. \"Sintra, Portugal. I like to stay away from the larger cities when I travel. Instead, I tend to rent a car and see the smaller towns. Sintra, a beautiful town 20 minutes outside of Lisbon, is one of those places. I planned just one day there but could’ve spent a couple more. There's a colorful castle, an ancient fort, and gorgeous views all around. Our hotel was a magical villa/hotel-walled garden in the center of town. I would spend an afternoon swimming and lazing surrounded by flowers.\"\nJoson / Getty Images\n\n—homeymagician35\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n3. \"I highly recommend the Seto Inland Sea between Hiroshima, Beppu, and Kure. There are lots of small and bigger islands. It's a great destination for fishing, beaches, mountains, onsens, hiking, food, and nature. Many parts of it feel extremely untouched.\"\nTororo / Getty Images\n\n—u/Setagaya-Observer\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n4. \"Budapest. I have traveled there six times now. Many people visit Prague over Budapest, which is a mistake, IMO. Like Prague, the city spans both sides of a river, one old and one new. But Budapest is much bigger and more interesting. There’s a castle, an underground labyrinth, a bunker/hospital built into the rocks, thermal spas, a beautiful parliament building, and art galleries galore. It has its own currency, and it is very cheap. The weather is lovely in the summer, and the food is great. What’s not to love?\"\nStuart Westmorland / Getty Images\n\n—sweetelf57\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n5. \"Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city felt like a fairytale — just beautiful. And it's steeped in history, most of which is shocking and stunningly recent.\"\nLeonid Andronov / Getty Images\n\n—ki123\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n6. \"Hydra, Greece. My wife and I just took a long Greek honeymoon. One island we really liked that isn't as well known as Santorini and Mykonos was Hydra. In fact, it was probably our favorite island. There isn't much to do or see there, but it was very laid back and chill. It was basically a vacation from our vacation, which we needed after a couple of busy days of sightseeing in Athens and before we went partying in Mykonos. There aren't any cars on the island, only donkeys, and it's very walkable and small.\"\nFotofantastika / Getty Images\n\n—flyerboy6\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n7. \"Siem Reap, Cambodia. I wasn’t expecting much, but it quickly became the highlight of my trip to Asia. There were amazing food options for a great price, tons of cultural experiences, and an overall really comfortable and safe environment. I really enjoyed Angkor Wat, exploring the archaeological temple from so long ago.\"\nVincent Jary / Getty Images\n\n—hiddenhero16\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n8. \"Romania! I spent two weeks driving around. It's a gorgeous country, with many UNESCO properties, beautiful farmland, gorgeous mountains, and incredibly friendly people.\"\nAlexander Spatari / Getty Images\n\n—comfyghost26\n\n\"Romania was the most wonderful surprise for me. We went in the autumn, and Sibiu, Brasov, and also Sinaia were almost breathtakingly beautiful, thanks to colorful leaves, mountains, the wild forests, and the castles. It's also quite an affordable destination, and everyone was kind to us. It far exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended.\"\n\n—u/grijo633\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n9. \"The Hague. It's like Amsterdam but way more relaxed. I preferred the coffee shops in The Hague to those everywhere else in the Netherlands. It’s a really beautiful city with a lovely main square. And the Mauritshuis museum there houses Vermeer's famous 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring.'\"\nWestend61 / Getty Images/Westend61\n\n—JP45132\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n10. \"New Mexico. The whole state is underrated, but specifically Albuquerque, Taos, and the New Mexican desert. The scenery is utterly breathtaking, the culture and history are unique, and the food is delicious. You'll know why people call it 'The Land of Enchantment' as soon as you see the Sandia Mountains glowing pink at sunset.\"\nMona Makela Photography / Getty Images\n\n—u/tinyowlinahat\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n11. \"Pienza, Italy. Whereas some of the bigger Tuscan towns like Siena and Montepulciano felt a bit touristy, Pienza was truly a hidden gem. It's right in the picturesque Val d'Orcia overlooking vineyards and rolling hills, home to cute, family-run restaurants, tiny shops selling local wine and Pecorino cheese, and stunning Medieval buildings. Everywhere you look, it seems like it came straight out of a postcard. It was one of the most beautiful towns I've ever seen.\"\nAdam Jones / Getty Images\n\n—Hannah Loewentheil\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n12. \"Taipei, Taiwan. While Taipei is already quite a popular destination in Asia, it's not as well known as other international cities like Tokyo, Shanghai, Bangkok, Osaka, Beijing, Seoul, and Singapore. I had already visited a handful of these major cities, but never Taipei, and I didn't expect to be overly impressed. But much to my (pleasant) surprise, Taipei and Taiwan became my favorite place in Asia. The food is nothing short of heavenly, and it's surprisingly affordable. The famous night markets are truly worth the hype...\"\nPhoto By Young.orange / Getty Images\n\n\"...Taipei has so much to offer: You can hike at Elephant Mountain for the most gorgeous view of the city, ride a gondola at Maokong, shop in the trendy Ximending neighborhood, and relax in the hot springs in Beitou. Then there are the outskirts of Taipei like Yehliu, Shifen, and Jiufen. All of these places are so full of natural beauty. The Taiwanese people I encountered were easily some of the nicest, kindest, and most helpful.\"\n\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n13. \"Vietnam overall, but especially Hoi An. I went in with very high expectations, but Hoi An still blew them away. The locals are incredibly kind and friendly, the architecture and scenery were beautiful, and the coffee was excellent, as was the food (and it was surprisingly cheap). I spent three weeks in Vietnam about two years ago, but I still think about this trip every day.\"\nMatthew Micah Wright / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n14. \"Salvador, Brazil. This city is well known in Brazil and somewhat well known in Latin America, but it never gets mentioned by international travelers in the same way as Río, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, Medellín, or Mexico City, much less any major European cities.\"\nGonzalo Azumendi / Getty Images\n\n—u/jp_books\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n15. \"The Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. This whole area, specifically Homer, the city at the end of the peninsula, is incredible to visit. The scenery is everything you could ever dream of: There are sprawling mountains overlooking the coast, and it's just so magical. If you like Colorado, you will love the Kenai Peninsula.\"\nBkamprath / Getty Images\n\n—amykayhansen1987\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n16. \"Aveiro, a little town in Portugal. On my way to Porto, I decided to stop in Coimbra and somehow ended up in Aveiro. It's a quaint little town with a canal, and everything about it is so pretty, from the delightful designs on the pavement to the colorful boats on the canal. I was mesmerized. l spent two days just wandering around and taking it all in.\"\nD. Giraldez Alonso / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n17. \"Rovinj, Croatia. I spent three nights in Rovinj and Croatia's Istrian peninsula as part of a three-week European roadtrip. In retrospect, I wish we spent at least a week there. I haven't come across many more romantic settings. Between the food (fresh seafood and truffles), the scenery (gorgeous land and sea vistas), the fascinating history, the super nice people, and the fact that nearly everyone is fluent in English, Rovinj blew away our expectations.\"\nThethomsn / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n18. \"I was floored by the food and the views in Grenoble, France. I expected it to be beautiful as it is very close to the Alps, but I still wasn’t prepared for the reality of it.\"\nL. Toshio Kishiyama / Getty Images\n\n—u/shrinkinghubris\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n19. \"Tallinn, Estonia. I went last year because I wanted to take a European vacation, but I didn’t want to be surrounded by tons of crowds. Tallinn is a sweet city with an amazing and historic old town village. The food blew my mind, and the bread, in particular, was the best I’ve ever had. The whole city is easily walkable, and the locals are charming and welcoming. You can even take a two-hour boat ride to Helsinki. I loved it so much I’m going back again this year.\"\nKarl Hendon / Getty Images\n\n—alycakes6\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n20. \"Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. It's on the west coast of France in Basque Country. Imagine the perfect beach town, but without the overwhelming crowds of Nice or Marseille. Plus, you’re a quick drive from San Sebastián, Spain, another incredible destination. The food, architecture, and culture were amazing. Basque French culture is so different from the rest of France, and the food is to die for. I’d recommend this over Paris or other popular tourist sites in France.\"\nMarioguti / Getty Images\n\n—mbowen0819\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21. \"Zermatt, Switzerland. I visited on my first trip to Europe. Everything about Europe blew me away, especially Zermatt. It's a small mountain town right at the base of the Matterhorn, and the views are breathtaking. We went on an amazing hike, went zip-lining, and took a gondola and train ride up into the Alps for more spectacular views. My favorite experience of all was a mountain bike ride that led to an adorable flock of sheep in the middle of the path. Zermatt itself was a super cute albeit expensive town. 10/10 would recommend.\"\n@ Didier Marti / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\n\n\"It's a city completely free of cars that is an adventure just to get to itself. Once there, you're met with incredible views, food, people, and activities.\"\n\n—u/projectbiker\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n22. \"Slovenia. My wife was born there, and we go back every other year to see her family and friends. It's such a beautiful country. The secret is starting to get out now, especially Instagrammable places like Lake Bled and Predjama Grad. Granted, it's still nowhere near as crowded as similar countries like Croatia.\"\nViaframe / Getty Images\n\n—u/gratusin\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n23. \"Gdansk, Poland. The Old Town looked straight out of a movie set. It has great architecture and history and is not as touristy as many other European cities. I also met some of the nicest people in Gdansk.\"\nAldo Pavan / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n24. \"Ecuador is a place that really blew me away. I had a few weeks off before starting a new job and joined some friends for a last-minute adventure cruise around the Galapagos Islands. It was a last-minute decision, but the Galapagos was absolutely mind-blowing. It was so untouched and pure and stunning, and we woke up to a new island to explore every day. It was the adventure of a lifetime. But mainland Ecuador is what really surprised me. I thought it would just be a pass-through stop on my way to Galapagos, but I was so pleasantly surprised.\"\nEduardo Fonseca Arraes / Getty Images\n\n\"I spent two nights in Quito, where there is incredible architecture, amazing food, a tourist-friendly culture, and beautiful mountains. Then I visited a little surf town called Montanita. It wasn't even on my radar, but it was there that I had the most amazing week of surfing, drinking, eating the freshest food I've ever had, and relaxing on the beach. Do yourself a favor and carve out some time to explore mainland Ecuador. It exceeded all expectations!\"\n\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n25. \"Heidelberg, Germany. We visited much bigger cities on the same trip, and I didn’t know much about Heidelberg before visiting. But it turned out to be a beautiful city with spectacular architecture and excellent food. I spent two weeks in Europe, but some of the best things I ate were in Heidelberg. The hills, colorful buildings, and river were just gorgeous, plus there were stunning ancient castles around. The city itself had winding, cobblestone streets that were just so charming. It was just as wonderful as other big cities we visited, but it was smaller, cleaner, and cozier.\"\nQuerbeet / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n—Anonymous\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n26. \"Perugia, Italy. This city is about two hours from Florence by train. It's a fully walled city with a medieval city center. All of the food I ate there was so delicious. I'd highly recommend visiting if you are interested in archaeology or if you're just searching for a beautiful place. I was only supposed to stay overnight but ended up staying two extra days.\"\nPeter Zelei Images / Getty Images\n\n—u/naoiseke1\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n27. \"Santiago, Chile. The weather is nice, the city boasts amazing views of the snow-capped mountains, there's good public transit, and the Plaza de las Armas is very cool. I think this city is one of the most livable cities in Latin America.\"\nEdsel Querini / Getty Images\n\n—u/ReflexPoint\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n28. \"Essaouira, Morocco. It’s an absolutely beautiful coastal town with lots of great views, plus it's very clean and walkable. We stopped there while traveling from Marrakech to Rabat and really enjoyed it!\"\nFederica Gentile / Getty Images\n\n—u/mylovelanguageiswine\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n29. \"Bournemouth, UK. I went in September and got beautiful, sunny weather the whole day. This resort town located two and a half hours from London has a beach and a gorgeous pier that overlooks the water. There's plenty to do there: The Russell-Cotes museum is a brilliant, hidden gem, and there's a serene memorial gravesite for Percy B. Shelley and Mary Shelley. It's so peaceful that there are even goats hanging out on the seaside cliffs. The town is quite walkable with lots of cute shops. We collected seashells on the beach and ended our day with a glass of champagne seaside. It was total perfection and is well worthy of a day trip.\"\nMaremagnum / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n30. \"Dijon, France. It's a city in the Burgundy region, which is home to amazing wine, cheese, and a UNESCO medieval old town.\"\nMats Silvan / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n31. \"Laos. Traveling down the Mekong River was incredible. The landscapes were beautiful, the people were so kind, and the towns were magical.\"\nOleh_slobodeniuk / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n32. \"Kerala, India. The landscape is so pretty and so lush. The locals were all so friendly and treated everyone like family. Everywhere we visited felt like the perfect mix of traditional and modern. I would definitely recommend visiting, but be sure to take a houseboat ride and visit some of the many historic castle forts and palaces.\"\nAnders Blomqvist / Getty Images\n\n—Anonymous\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n33. \"Sri Lanka. Damn, it is beautiful, and this country has it all: beaches, forests, mountains, ancient temples, and wildlife safaris. I loved the food there, including lots of curry. The beach areas offer a lot more culinary variety, like lots of fresh seafood.\"\nOleh_slobodeniuk / Getty Images\n\n—u/blahblahrasputan\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n34. \"Savannah, Georgia. I won a free stay at a hotel there, so I went into the trip with no expectations. I ended up loving it, though. Savannah is such a cute city with so much history and character. There are excellent museums, restaurants, and tours.\"\nZimmytws / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n—kasandram4131cc089\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n35. \"Edinburgh absolutely blew my mind. My best friend and I were taking a trip across the UK in 2019. We had already seen London with its massive old buildings, but nothing could have prepared us for the stunning views of Edinburgh. The moment we stepped out of the railway station, we stood in the middle of the road gazing at the architecture. The scenery made us feel like we had entered a real-life Harry Potter universe. I would absolutely visit the city again!\"\nThomas Faull / Getty Images\n\n—pavirsk\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n36. \"Ottawa is very underrated in Canada. It’s a beautiful city with lots of greenery.

Yes No Swiss Alps #1 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Snow-covered mountains, charming towns and flower-strewn meadows make the Swiss Alps a year-round fairy-tale destination. Visit in the winter for world-class skiing (and après-ski fondue and drinks) in locales such as the exclusive St. Moritz and the picturesque Zermatt, home of the craggy Matterhorn. Opt for warmer months to hike through the verdant valleys of Swiss National Park or attend lively festivals in the foothill town of Montreux. Regardless of the time of year, no trip would be complete without a visit to the Jungfrau Region, where you can saunter through idyllic mountain villages like Grindelwald and Mürren or take the Jungfrau Railway to Europe's highest railway station. Read More Things To DoTours View 38 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Bora Bora #2 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 What this 12-square-mile French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here, you'll find picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts set on surrounding islets. The island's extinct volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and postcard-worthy white sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is pricey, most travelers say it's worth every penny. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 89 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Rome #3 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 When you visit Italy's capital city, prepare to cross a few must-see landmarks – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Travelers can also see some of Italy's greatest treasures, including St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, in Vatican City. Once you get your bearings, peruse some of Rome's lesser-known museums, art galleries and boutiques, or head to Janiculum Hill for panoramic views of the city. The Eternal City is always popular, but with the Catholic Jubilee taking place throughout 2025, expect even more crowds and book accommodations and airfare well in advance. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 32 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Machu Picchu #4 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 A visit to this UNESCO-listed Peruvian wonder is not for the faint of heart, but it is often described as a life-changing adventure. Built by the Incas in the mid-15th century, Machu Picchu encompasses well-preserved agricultural, residential and religious structures. While the four-day hike along the Inca Trail is challenging (you'll climb to an elevation of roughly 8,000 feet), arriving at the site during sunrise is well worth the effort. Limited daily reservations are available for this popular trail, but visitors can also opt for a handful of less-traveled paths or take a PeruRail train to the mountain base for an easier route to the top. Best HotelsTours View 42 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Tokyo #5 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Simply setting foot in Japan's frenetic capital city is an experience. Known for its bustling streets and flashing neon signs, Tokyo has an electric energy and ample top attractions to discover. Foodies won't be disappointed by Tokyo's fresh sushi and hearty ramen (not to mention more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other city in the world). Shopaholics will find plenty of must-have designer products in Ginza, while those seeking a respite in nature can visit Shinjuku Gyoen or Yoyogi Park. Meanwhile, history buffs will appreciate Tokyo's centuries-old temples and shrines. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 85 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Maui #6 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Whether you're driving along the Road to Hana, enjoying a bird's-eye view of Maui's lush coastline on a helicopter tour, snorkeling with sea turtles or simply relaxing on white or black sand beaches, you'll find that this Hawaiian island is unlike any other tropical destination. Don't miss a chance to visit Haleakalā National Park, which is home to one of the world's largest dormant volcanic craters and boasts surreal sunrises. You should also attend a traditional lūʻau for a dose of local culture and a taste of Hawaiian specialties like poi, poke and kālua pig.

Yes No Maldives #7 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 It is not cheap or easy to reach, but this isolated Indian Ocean vacation spot located southwest of India is the embodiment of a dreamy tropical retreat. In this remote country, which is made up of more than 1,000 islands, thatched-roof overwater bungalows sit above the bright aquamarine sea, providing easy water access and a romantic atmosphere. On this once-in-a-lifetime vacation, fill your days with beach trips, spa treatments and snorkeling or scuba diving excursions. If cabin fever sets in, take a day trip to an island village like Fulidhoo or Rinbudhoo for a taste of local culture. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 25 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Tanzania #8 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 A top-tier safari destination, this East African country draws wildlife enthusiasts hoping to catch a glimpse of Serengeti National Park's big five: the lion, the rhino, the leopard, the elephant and the buffalo. If you can foot the bill, stay in one of Tanzania's swoon-worthy tented camps that take glamping to another level. Beyond Serengeti, Tanzania houses 21 other national parks, including one dedicated to Africa's tallest peak, Kilimanjaro. You'll be tempted to spend your whole trip exploring Tanzania's inland terrain, but be sure to build in some recovery time on the white sand beaches of outlying islands like Zanzibar and Pemba. Tours View 27 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Great Barrier Reef #9 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 The globe's largest collection of coral reefs – and one of the original Seven Natural Wonders of the World – touts one-of-a-kind scenery. At Australia's Great Barrier Reef, you'll find more than 600 islands and 1,600-plus species of fish. Though plenty of diving and snorkeling spots can be found along Queensland's coast, to escape the crowds, visit the Whitsunday Islands (which happen to have some of the world's best beaches). Tourists can expect to pay a small daily environmental tax that is crucial for reef preservation. Opting for eco-friendly digs and low-impact tours (such as kayaking excursions) can also help protect this natural treasure. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 15 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Petra #10 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Dating back to the fourth century B.C., Jordan's ancient Nabataean city is an architectural standout. Once you wind your way through a narrow canyon (the Siq) and the magnificent Treasury comes into view, you'll instantly see why Petra is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. This well-preserved, intricate mausoleum is worth the trip on its own. Still, you'll want to continue on to Petra's other impressive structures, all skillfully carved from sandstone, including the Street of Facades, the Monastery and the Royal Tombs. Once you've seen all the sights by day, return for Petra by Night, when the Siq and the Treasury glow with the light of 1,500 candles. Tours View 48 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Glacier National Park #11 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows and azure lakes are just a few reasons why Glacier National Park is one of America's most striking parks. There are more than 700 miles of hiking trails in this Montana crown jewel, plus 13 designated areas for camping. In the winter, travelers can enjoy snowshoeing and skiing, while summer vacationers can go swimming in Lake McDonald and whitewater rafting on Flathead River, among other popular activities. For those who'd rather admire their surroundings from their car, a scenic drive along Going-to-the-Sun Road can't be missed. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 48 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No South Island, New Zealand #12 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 New Zealand's South Island brims with majestic landscapes at every turn, from dramatic mountains to spectacular fjords. Here, you can hike through the mountains of Fiordland National Park or admire them from a boat on Milford Sound/Piopiotahi. At night, journey to the University of Canterbury's Mount John Observatory to gaze at the starry skies. You can also indulge your inner daredevil in Queenstown (a favorite destination among bungee jumpers), sample delicious sauvignon blanc in the Marlborough region or explore New Zealand's most accessible glaciers – Franz Josef and Fox Glacier – on the island's west coast. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 84 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Paris #13 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 France's magnetic City of Light is a perennial tourist destination, drawing visitors with its iconic attractions like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and its unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Quaint cafes, trendy shopping districts and Haussmann architecture give Paris its timeless beauty. But the city's best asset is that you're likely to discover something new with each trip or season (read: Paris is always a good idea). To best explore France's ever-changing capital, get lost wandering the charming cobblestone streets, learn its secrets on a walking tour, head to dynamic art exhibits like the Atelier des Lumières or gourmandize at the latest restaurants and pastry shops. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 45 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Costa Rica #14 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 From volcanic mountains and verdant rainforests to tumbling waterfalls and miles of stunning shoreline, Costa Rica is a Central American gem. Explore the beaches along the Nicoya Peninsula, hike around the base of Arenal Volcano and spot exotic wildlife (think: river turtles, otters and howler monkeys) in remote Tortuguero National Park. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, go swimming next to Guanacaste's waterfalls or zip line through the rainforests of Manuel Antonio National Park. Then, head back to an eco-luxury all-inclusive resort to unwind. Just make sure you plan a visit during Costa Rica's dry season, which falls between December and April.

Yes No Yellowstone National Park #15 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 A visit to this national park in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming is considered by many to be a rite of passage for Americans, and it's sure to leave you in awe of nature's power. Marvel at the kaleidoscopic waters of the Grand Prismatic Spring, catch the Old Faithful geyser's nearly hourly show, admire (from a safe distance) the roaming bison in the Lamar and Hayden valleys or simply relax with a picnic at Yellowstone Lake. To get more in touch with nature, reserve a spot at one of Yellowstone's 12 campgrounds and spend the night beneath the stars. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 122 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No London, England #16 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 London is a world unto itself. The eclectic neighborhoods, which are home to a blend of historical landmarks and modern-day attractions, can keep you occupied for days. If it's your first time in London, join a tour that takes you past top spots like the Tate Modern art institution, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, Borough Market and the British Museum, before sitting down to a classic afternoon tea or checking out a local pub for a Sunday roast. Once you've seen the major sights, stroll through the posh streets of Mayfair or Chelsea, and admire the gardens at one of London's 3,000 parks. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 56 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Grand Canyon National Park #17 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Measuring roughly 277 miles long, 18 miles wide and about a mile deep, the Grand Canyon is brimming with outdoor activities for everyone from day-trippers to adventure junkies. Hike along the national park's popular Rim and Bright Angel trails for unparalleled vistas, cool off with a whitewater rafting excursion down the Colorado River or view the dramatic Arizona landscape from above during a helicopter tour. If you're feeling especially daring, sign up for a skydiving excursion above the canyon. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 38 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Banff #18 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 An Alberta town full of acclaimed restaurants, breweries, boutiques and art galleries, Banff makes for an exciting vacation in every season. Vacationers can spend their days hiking, relaxing in hot springs and boating on scenic lakes. Banff's location within the Canadian Rockies also makes it easy for visitors to access Banff National Park, which boasts some of the world's most beautiful vistas. Inside the park, travelers can admire sweeping views of the Bow Valley from the Banff Gondola or while schussing the slopes at the park's three ski resorts.

Yes No Amsterdam #19 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Famous museums, tulips, canal-lined streets, \"coffeeshops\" and high-end boutiques await you in Amsterdam. Here, you can spend your days gazing at Vincent van Gogh paintings, relaxing in Vondelpark and shopping in The Nine Streets area. Immerse yourself in Amsterdam's street food scene by eating herring or Dutch fries, or satisfy your sweet tooth with stroopwafels. You can also do as the Dutch do and rent a bicycle to tour the city. If you plan on visiting in spring, don't miss the Keukenhof gardens, where you can view millions of colorful flowers. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 38 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Turks & Caicos #20 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Located north of the Dominican Republic, this collection of roughly 100 islands and cays is popular with honeymooners – and for good reason. With sparkling white sand, crystal-clear water and nearly 350 miles of colorful coral reef, the Turks and Caicos Islands are truly a sight to behold. While you'd be remiss to visit this quintessential Caribbean stunner and not spend a day or two lounging on Grace Bay Beach on Providenciales, those seeking a more active getaway will have plenty of opportunities to snorkel, scuba dive and ride horses along the coast. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 59 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Barcelona #21 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 This Spanish city is a feast for the eyes: Visitors can walk past medieval architecture in the Barri Gòtic, snap photos of the intricate Basílica de la Sagrada Família and gape at more of Antoni Gaudí's whimsical creations in Park Güell. Meanwhile, Barceloneta Beach and the Parc de la Ciutadella are perfect places to pass the time on a sunny day before checking out the restaurants and bars in the Gracia district, which buzzes at all hours of the night. Though the weather may be chilly, plan an off-peak winter visit to avoid the city's ever-growing crowds. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 16 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Chiang Mai #22 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Tucked in the mountains of northern Thailand, subdued Chiang Mai feels worlds away from Bangkok's buzz, offering an approachable introduction to the country's urban culture. While here, visit some of the temples within the old city walls and shop for handicrafts at a night market. The city also boasts some next-level cooking classes; many feature small groups, hands-on teaching and a visit to a local market. What's more, Chiang Mai is the perfect jumping-off point for exploring the surrounding scenery. Take a day trip to a nearby hot spring, tour a local coffee farm or plan a camping trip in Doi Inthanon National Park. Best HotelsTours View 22 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Chilean Patagonia #23 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Attention explorers: The granite peaks, glacier fields, fjords and rainforests of Patagonia are calling. Chile's long sliver of this rugged region stretches 1,000 miles from north to south, encompassing some of the best that Patagonia has to offer. Outdoor enthusiasts up for a challenge can hike among hanging glaciers on the dayslong W Trek in Torres del Paine National Park, kayak on crisp blue waters in the Lake District and seek out penguins on Isla Magdalena. December through February (South America's summer season) is the ideal time to visit, but you'll still want to bundle up against the notoriously strong winds that pummel Patagonia year-round. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 53 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Istanbul #24 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Between heated haggling in the Grand Bazaar, the undulating call to prayer and the constant screech of shorebirds, Istanbul is a rush of sounds. This vivacious city, split between Asia and Europe, is better to be absorbed than explored. Find quiet moments in renowned religious sites (think: the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia), take your time admiring ancient marvels (such as the underground Basilica Cistern) and immerse yourself in age-old customs (from Turkish tea to Turkish baths). Cap off your trip at the top of the Galata Tower or on a cruise along the Bosphorus to take in Istanbul's vast sprawl. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 50 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Sydney #25 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Sydney offers more than just a dizzying array of famous landmarks, such as the Sydney Opera House, Mrs. Macquarie's Chair and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This Australian metropolis boasts a warm, sunny climate that is ideal for relaxing or surfing at world-renowned beaches like Coogee, Bondi and Manly. Be sure to peruse the art and architecture at Sydney's new addition, the Art Gallery of New South Wales museum campus, or get an overview of the city's history and culture at the Hyde Park Barracks and the Australian Museum.

Yes No Dubai #26 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Stunning Persian Gulf views, heart-pumping activities and sleek skyscrapers await you in Dubai. This Middle Eastern city is filled with some of the world's most notable and unique attractions, including the Dubai Mall, indoor Ski Dubai and Burj Khalifa, the tallest building on the planet. But the city still holds onto its heritage, as seen in the Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood and the traditional Gold and Spice souks. When you need a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, head to a sandy shore like Jumeirah Public Beach, Sunset Beach or Al Mamzar Beach Park. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 51 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No St. Lucia #27 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Dotted with luxurious boutique hotels and stunning mountainside resorts, this Caribbean destination is ideal for lovebirds and adrenaline junkies. Those seeking relaxation will find it on St. Lucia's unspoiled shorelines (specifically Reduit Beach and Anse Chastanet). Meanwhile, adventure seekers can test their limits by climbing Gros Piton or zip lining through the Babonneau rainforest. The dry season, from December to April, is the most popular (and expensive) time to visit, but budget-conscious travelers can find superb weather and cheaper room rates if they arrive in May or June. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 26 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Santorini #28 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Frequently touted as a top honeymoon destination, Greece's most popular isle woos newlyweds every year with its breathtaking sunsets, whitewashed villages and colorful beaches. Archaeological sites, such as Ancient Thera and the prehistoric Akrotiri, beckon to history buffs, while Santorini's wine tours lure oenophiles. Work up an appetite by hiking along the rim of the caldera, then head to scenic Amoudi Bay to dine alfresco. Meanwhile, travelers looking for a relaxing day trip can hop on a boat to the nearby island of Thirassia. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 42 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Bali #29 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Scenic temples and beautiful beaches are the biggest draws to this lush Indonesian paradise. And we do mean lush – the region's notoriously soggy wet season is best avoided by planning a visit between April and October. Just know that you won't have the sand to yourself in this in-demand destination. Break up your beach time with a visit to the village of Kintamani, home to a towering (and active) volcano, as well as a large lake. If you're craving an adrenaline rush, hop on one of Bali's many swings to soar above rice terraces and jungles. Meanwhile, foodies can whip up some nasi goreng during a Balinese cooking class. Read More Best HotelsThings To DoTours View 37 Photos Belongs on List? Yes No Galapagos Islands #30 in World's Best Places to Visit for 2025 Traveling to this archipelago roughly 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador will take some planning. But for aspiring naturalists, the journey is well worth it for the opportunity to see wildlife that can't be found anywhere else on Earth. Living proof of Charles Darwin's natural selection theory, species like the blue-footed booby, the giant tortoise and the pink land iguana are uniquely adapted to the islands' harsh conditions. Don't forget to take a peek under the water – snorkeling is a must – but leave room for some lounge time on one of the Galapagos' stark-white shorelines.

"Go to travel r/travel • 10 mo. ago AliveRelationship551 Which country do you think is the PERFECT tourist destination according to your personal experience? Question I have been to 44 countries and I find Japan to be the PERFECT tourist destination. Japan is well endowed with a rich cultural heritage, diverse and breathtaking natural scenery and the hospitality is top notch. Japanese cuisine is designated UNESCO intangible heritage. There are 47 prefectures in Japan. Each prefectures has its own distinctive character. I have been to Japan 6 times and I have never been bored with it. There is so much to do, see and experience in Japan. Japan is truly the most perfect country for tourism based on my experience. What about you?

Since I'm from Japan, I only miss the quiet streets (no car horns at all here), be prepared to hear horns all day long. Another thing that is great about Vietnam is that I'm probably less scammed than in other places that I've visited.

Reply reply Share Share [deleted] • 10mo ago rebeccavt • 10mo ago I’ve been to 60 countries and Vietnam 3 times, and it’s definitely one of my absolute favorite destinations. It’s so vibrant and quirky, with amazing food, it feels safe, it’s constantly changing, and the people are really friendly. They have become really good at tourism over the past 15 years. I didn’t experience anyone trying to scam me, except maybe some aggressive sales tactics at some markets. Reply reply Share Share 14 more replies dallyan • 10mo ago As an older solo woman, would it be a good idea to do a 2-week vacation there? Is that enough time? Is it ok to travel alone? Reply reply Share Share rebeccavt • 10mo ago Yes! 2 weeks is a great amount of time, and as a solo-female traveler myself, I found it to be really safe. I do recommend hiring a guide, it’s not too expensive and they can be really fun to travel with. Reply reply Share Share MyFaceSpaceBook • 10mo ago I only visited Hanoi and loved it. The shoe repair men who roam the streets will gladly repair your sole if they think it's loose. Some \"free\" food samples became sales. I never felt uncomfortable except for crossing roads. It is crazy. The advice is: walk, don't run, don't stop and don't turn back. It's almost magical how the motorbikes will just weave around you. I wish I had made a video of it.

It was pretty hostile towards a female solo traveller, I was told I couldn't go into so many places. There was a lot of indirect sexual harrassment, like having my picture taken in the metro. It was also not the easiest for logistics, like I was fine in the end, but things often took a lot of trial and error to get right, and there wasn't always an English option to book things.I personally find everywhere I have been in Europe, including the Balkans easier to navigate As for me, I don't think the perfect destination exists, because it is so dependent on your personal context specially your race, gender and sexuality. However I keep going back to Spain and France. Poland is super easy and has a lot to do. I love the Balkans but they are far from perfect and I will be the first to admit it. Reply reply Share Share les_be_disasters • 10mo ago • Edited 10mo ago I’m in Japan right now and agree that more populated areas are/can be a struggle as a woman. But wandering the rural parts has been lovely. The median age out here is like 86 and widowed and people are very different than how they are in the cities.

A close second is Taiwan. Street food / casual quick bites are also so much easier to find in Asia. When I'm in Europe I miss going to a Lawson or Family Mart to grab a quick bite on the go. Spain and Italy are two of my favorite countries to see things. So much amazing architecture, heritage sites, and diverse scenery to boot. I remember taking a train from Florence to Genoa (IIRC), fell asleep briefly, woke up to the ocean on my left and mountain cliffs on my right. It was surreal. As for a city, nothing is comparable to Rome. When I'm retired and have done my travel goals I want to just spend a month in Rome staring at random ancient buildings. And the entire city of Florence is an art. Venice is a PITA bc of crowds but hey I'm so glad I didn't die before seeing it. I grew up around Disneyland and was completely flabbergasted people would even compare this miracle of a city to a theme park. WTF forreals. Southern Spain is something else. La Alhambra puts most other architectural works to shame. And I know Barcelona doesn't have the best reputation, but I've always loved it. The weather, the architecture, the walks along the beach seeing local kids play beach volleyball. The best meal in Gràcia where the loveliest owner tried to convey to me \"belly cut\" by pointing at her own stomach.

I prefer the style of Spain and Italy but if we are talking about pure tourism, France. The sheer number of beatiful villages, cities and historical sites is astonishing. They also have more $$ so the sites are always well kept and renoved with top notch facilities. Their castles and historical buildings are more pretty and grandiose than Spain and Italy. They have a wide variety of sceneries, regions and climate from the hot south a la italian to the rugged Brittany where you feel like in Ireland. Reply reply Share Share [deleted] • 10mo ago [deleted] • 10mo ago • Edited 10mo ago France is my answer too. I enjoy outdoor travel and they have the Alps and Pyrenees (plus other options) and they don’t ruin them by not allowing backpacking like so many other countries. There are places I prefer for outdoor or urban travel, but if I want to do both or rate a country on both, France it is. Obviously it’s very strong in the cultural department. I also find French people to be fine if you just learn their etiquette. I think a lot of the rude French people thing come from people who can’t be assed to learn to say “sorry, I don’t speak French, do you speak English or is Translate okay?” and learn the greetings. Reply reply Share Share 5 more replies bikealjackson • 10mo ago Portugal! I travelled all throughout my 20s and used to never want to return to the same place twice since there was so much to see in the world. However, I'm heading back to Portugal now for my 3rd extended visit. Love the beaches, the people, the food, the whole vibe there. Its great! Reply reply Share Share talliehoo • 10mo ago what’s your favorite place in portugal you’ve been to? Reply reply Share Share bikealjackson • 10mo ago Lagos is my absolute favorite place! I love staying out by the less touristy beaches and spending my days swimming and reading. Such a stunning area! Reply reply Share Share 2 more replies 1 more reply msumner7 • 10mo ago Hard agree! Didn't meet a single local who wasn't friendly and welcoming when approached with a smile and a couple basic words in Portuguese. Plus every small town we seemed to end up in had an amazing historical site you could tour for a couple Euro and everything was very affordable!

Reply reply Share Share 6 more replies pegman55 • 10mo ago Iceland was lovely Reply reply Share Share 7 more replies z399 • 10mo ago Argentina. People are talkative and kind but not over the top. Diverse amount of nature and foods from other cultures that meld into one. Have been twice and would come back a third time. Reply reply Share Share 1 more reply kwguy77 • 10mo ago The way you described Japan is how I feel about Mexico. So far, Mexico is my top spot. Reply reply Share Share pwo_addict • 10mo ago Mexico is my #1, too. People just don’t understand how spectacular it is. Reply reply Share Share 5 more replies 13 more replies drcoxmonologues • 10mo ago I think it depends on your age. When I was in my 20’s Thailand had it all for me. Beaches, culture, food, partying like crazy, cheap, safe, exotic. Now I’m in my 40s and have travelled all over the world Thailand is still up there but not much beats the USA for sheer diversity of geography and cities/towns. You can get food that is authentic from pretty much any cuisine in the world. The people are nice, Americans are generally very friendly. Some of it isn’t safe but that can be said for anywhere. If I could only ever visit one country again now it would be America. Reply reply Share Share 3 more replies Life-Rope89 • 10mo ago I have visited some 30-odd countries. Japan is lovely, yes. Caught the fall season there last year. It was beautiful. But I also loved Norway a lot. Lofoten is pure rugged beauty. No crowds. There are spots where you have everything in one frame - beach, snow, mountains, waterfall. And we spotted rainbows thrice in 3 days. It was out of the world. Reply reply Share Share 2 more replies catpunsfreakmeowt • 10mo ago Australia. My friend and I traveled the great ocean Road from Melbourne, then flew to Cairnes In order to drive up to Port Douglas to go diving the great barrier reef, then flew to Sydney to climb at the bridge and watch Macbeth at the Sydney opera house. It was an amazing trip! Reply reply Share Share wandpapierkritiker • 10mo ago Switzerland. Infrastructure, high quality of life, and one of the most beautiful places in the world. Reply reply Share Share 7 more replies efa7860 • 10mo ago Spain and Türkiye. I’ve been to both multiple times and can never get enough. Reply reply Share Share lysanderastra • 10mo ago I was blown away by Turkey when I went. I didn’t have many expectations or notions about what it would be like but it easily became one of my absolute favourite places Reply reply Share Share 2 more replies [deleted] • 10mo ago • Edited 10mo ago Where I have been to I would say Germany because they have so many great cities, which offers different experiences, great infrastructure, and museums, theater galore. I also would mention my birth country Brazil which has so much to offer, and also great experiences, except infrastructure might not be as great, but so much more to offer if you really look up the other places in Brazil besides Rio and Sao Paolo Reply reply Share Share 3 more replies [deleted] • 10mo ago BetaCuck_1776 • 10mo ago Gotta be New Zealand. Incredible geographic diversity, great food, great coffee!!, great wine, not crazy expensive. You can go from Wellington and get any food imaginable to the middle of a volcanic plane surrounded by green mountains in just a couple of hours. Would go all the time if it weren’t so damn far away. Reply reply Share Share Live_Studio_Emu • 10mo ago I think Japan would be my number one as well, but I have to say Jordan is really up there. Middle Eastern country which is safe, but also has more character than the oil-rich states. The country is almost perfectly designed and shaped for a vacation. Start in Amman, then visit Petra, then Wadi Rum, then Dead Sea, then back to Amman and fly out, with other places can easily be added in around those. The people were great as well. All very friendly, and totally opposite to spots like Egypt. Baklava places gave it out for free because I only ordered a little, tour guides brought lunch that wasn’t part of the tour package to keep us with more time for the sights, locals helping tourists tie their scarves properly, coffee stores would make an effort to write my name in Arabic on the cup etc etc. There were lots of little nice interactions, and I can’t remember any bad ones. And then the food. Has to be one of my favourite cuisines, and everything was so fresh and delicious we ate only local food the entire time to make every meal count. Now that I think about it, maybe Jordan is my number one. Reply reply Share Share alloutofbees • 10mo ago Jordan was incredible, easily in my top three destinations. We went as a group of four women and drove ourselves. Driving was easy, people were incredibly hospitable (and the men were actually funny and not overbearing or threatening), food and hookah were top notch. We slept on cots in a Bedouin tent and stayed at a 5-star Dead Sea resort and I'd rank both of them among my favourite experiences ever. It really was pretty much perfect. Reply reply Share Share pazozo • 10mo ago I was going to say Jordan too! I went this March and hired a car and drove around. Felt very safe (even with everything happening on the bordering countries), the driving wasn't as scary as I thought, and didn't have any negative interactions. The history and the landscapes were just spectacular. Reply reply Share Share Live_Studio_Emu • 10mo ago I would describe Jordan as ‘the country that is what people want Egypt to be’ For what it’s worth, and the dislike it gets on this subreddit, I liked Egypt personally, but that was specifically because I was visiting with friends who are from there. I could clearly tell that my experience visiting without them would have been very different Reply reply Share Share 4 more replies globalfemme • 10mo ago I’m in Jordan now, excellent place! I echo everything said in the first comment. I’m a blonde female, drive around on my own, great experience. They could do with better roads though!
